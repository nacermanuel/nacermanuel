<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Manuel NÃ¡cer</h1>
<p align="center">
  Hello, I'm Manuel, a full-stack web developer. I've acquired my skills through a rigorous bootcamp called SoyHenry and extensive self-study, but my true expertise has come from building my own projects. My passion lies in leveraging technology as a problem solver, and my goal is to be part of prject that shares this vision.
  
  In addition to my technical skills, I have held leading roles in the operation of businesses with annual revenue surpassing USD$100,000. This hands-on experience has given me a deep understanding of commercial strategies, expertise in running complex Facebook ads campaigns, and a comprehensive grasp of financial structures within businesses. I leverage my tech skills and business expertise to bring value to the table.
